# AI-Powered Job Matching System

A sophisticated job-candidate matching system using NLP and Machine Learning to match job postings with candidate profiles, featuring semantic understanding and multi-criteria matching.

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Create and activate a new conda environment
conda create -n job_matching python=3.8
conda activate job_matching

# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn gensim spacy streamlit plotly thefuzz

# Download required spaCy model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
